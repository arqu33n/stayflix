## About the Project

My project is a web application designed for finding movies to watch in the evening, catering to individuals who prefer enjoying movies comfortably at home. The website serves as a convenient platform for users to discover a variety of films across different genres, helping them choose the perfect movie for a cozy night in.

Through intuitive search and filtering features, users can easily navigate through a diverse collection of movies, selecting titles based on genres, directors, ratings, or even opting for a random selection for added excitement.
